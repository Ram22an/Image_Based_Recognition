A Convolutional Layer (Conv Layer) is the core part of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
It extracts features from an image by applying filters (kernels) 
that detect patterns like edges, shapes, and textures.

How Does a Convolutional Layer Work?
✅ 1️⃣ Input Image → The image is given as a matrix of pixel values.
✅ 2️⃣ Apply a Filter (Kernel) → A small matrix (e.g., 3×3 or 5×5) slides over the image.
✅ 3️⃣ Perform Convolution (Dot Product) → The filter multiplies with pixel values and sums them up.
✅ 4️⃣ Create a Feature Map → The result forms a new smaller image showing detected features.

Original Image (6×6 Pixels):
1   2   3   4   5   6  
7   8   9  10  11  12  
13 14  15 16  17  18  
19 20  21 22  23  24  
25 26  27 28  29  30  
31 32  33 34  35  36  

3×3 Edge Detection Filter (Kernel):
-1  -1  -1  
-1   8  -1  
-1  -1  -1  

Output Size=(Input Size - Filter Size) + 1=(6−3)+1=4

First Window (Top-Left Corner of Image)
We take the first 3×3 section of the image:
1   2   3  
7   8   9  
13  14 15  

Multiply element-wise with the filter:
(1 × -1)  +  (2 × -1)  +  (3 × -1)  +  
(7 × -1)  +  (8 × 8)   +  (9 × -1)  +  
(13 × -1) +  (14 × -1) +  (15 × -1)  

=(−1−2−3−7+64−9−13−14−15)=0


Second Window (Moving Right)
Next, slide the filter one step to the right:
2   3   4  
8   9  10  
14 15  16  
Multiply element-wise with the filter:
=(−2−3−4−8+72−10−14−15−16)=0

Final 4×4 Feature Map:
0   0   0   0  
0  40  48  56  
0  72  80  88  
0 104 112 120
